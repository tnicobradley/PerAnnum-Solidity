# PerAnnum-Solidity
Per Annum is an ethereum token that has a time released psudo-mining function which only allows the token to be minted by calling the mining function during the first two weeks of each year. If the token allotment for the year is not reached, the remaining tokens are released to the contract creator's wallet upon the next call to the 'mine' function.
